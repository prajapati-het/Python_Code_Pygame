Exiting News!!! 😀 🎉 

There is a new game waiting for you...

Yes, you read it right.



Tetris-Game 😍 , that old nice game that made us engage into it 'till we finish it, is now here...



I have made game called : Tetris Game with Python module : pygame



This game taught me how to manage a game with no other than OOPs concepts, where every part of a game is like a class which helps me manipulate and find bugs and errors more easily as this isolates the code from rest of the world and implements Functional Independency
