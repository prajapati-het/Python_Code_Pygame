Tetris-Game üòç , that old nice game that made us engage into it 'till we finish it, is now here...

I have made game called : Tetris Game with Python module : pygame

This game taught me how to manage a game with no other than OOPs concepts, where every part of a game is like a class which helps me manipulate and find bugs and errors more easily as this isolates the code from rest of the world and implements Functional Independency

Steps to play game :
1) UP key will rotate the block
2) LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN keys will move the block in respective direction
3) IF Game Overs  , down arrow will restart the game

ENJOY.....
